== Description ==
MQ ReLinks is a wordpress plugin which allows you to easy make all external links in posts, comments and author links non external, by using a redirect.
In stead of a direct link to another site, the plugin will create a link to a out.php file that will redirect to the requested URL. They can be opened in a new window or in the same one.
You can configure the post, comment and author link options in the administration area.
For configuration go to Options>MQ ReLinks
A redirected link will look like this:
http://www.maiq.info/wp-content/plugins/mqrelinks/out.php?url=http://www.wordpress.org/
You can edit it to look like this:
http://www.maiq.info/out.php?url=http://www.wordpress.org/
To do so move the out.php to your wordpress root directory, go to the plugin administration page and delete the text from the "ReLinks out.php path" field.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip the downloaded package and upload the MQ ReLinks folder into your Wordpress plugins folder
2. Log into your WordPress admin panel
3. Go to Plugins and "Activate" the plugin
   "MQ ReLinks" will now be displayed in your Options section 
4. Configure it under Options -> MQ ReLinks

== Faq ==
I edited the "ReLinks out.php path" and moved the out.php file to the wordpress root directory but I get a 404 error. What do I do?

Deactivate and reactivate the plugin, then try again :)
